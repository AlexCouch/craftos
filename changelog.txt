Alex Couch, #1:
    * Fixed bug in messages wrapper where data packets put into the Common Data Space aren't put due to duplicate names. Names are now required for sending data to client/server.
    * Started implementing file paths. Paths need to be resolved correctly. Using paths in the file system needs to be improved upon.
    * File System right now tries to resolve paths when a path is passed into a file function such as makeDirectory, makeFile, changeDirectory, etc.
    * Files are now bound to a custom File Type that has a custom data format that is done in the readData and writeData function implementations.
    * Packages now have access to an exit function that *should* safely close the current package and switch back to the shell command line (terminal)

Maki325, #2:
    * Abstracted FileSystem class as an interface
    * Created CouchFileSystem - mostly as before, just using the interface(removed doesFileExistHere and makeFileHere as they are done using other function with here set to true)
    * Because of the remove of doesFileExistHere and makeFileHere code in some classes was changed to use doesFileExist and makeFile
    * Fixed the Gui not opening - it the system has started already, the start function wont be called which handles the opening of Gui, so I added some code that would activate Gui when the function to
        start the system is called(only if it is active)

    * A bug found when using command "cd home/packages"
